# UI Drafts Directory

This directory is dedicated to storing UI design drafts generated by other AI platforms or design tools. You can use this folder to import and integrate alternative UI designs into the evidence tracking system.

## How to Use This Directory

1. **Add AI-Generated Designs**: Place UI component files generated by other AI platforms in this folder.

2. **Component Structure**: Each component should be placed in its own directory with a consistent structure:
   ```
   /ui-drafts/
     /dashboard-v2/
       Dashboard.js
       Dashboard.css
       README.md (explaining the design choices)
     /evidence-list-v2/
       EvidenceList.js
       EvidenceList.css
       README.md
   ```

3. **Integration**: Once you've finalized a design, you can integrate it into the main application by:
   - Copying the component to the main `/components` directory
   - Updating imports in the relevant files
   - Ensuring it works with the theming system

## Theming Recommendations

When creating new UI designs, please consider:

1. **CSS Variables**: Use the CSS variables defined in `/themes/themes.css` to ensure your components work with the theme switching system:
   ```css
   .my-component {
     background-color: var(--card-background);
     color: var(--text-primary);
     border: 1px solid var(--border-color);
   }
   ```

2. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that designs work well on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

3. **Accessibility**: Use appropriate ARIA attributes, color contrast, and semantic HTML elements.

## Template Files

For easier creation of new components, you can copy starter templates from:
- `/ui-drafts/templates/component-template.js`
- `/ui-drafts/templates/component-template.css`

## Testing

You can test your UI draft components by:
1. Temporarily importing them in `App.js`
2. Creating a special route for testing
3. Comparing them side-by-side with existing components

## Component Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling when possible
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document any third-party dependencies
- Ensure compatibility with the theme system
